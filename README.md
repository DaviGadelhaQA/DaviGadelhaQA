# Davi Gadelha

**`Quality Assurance Engineer`**

I’m Davi Gadelha, a Quality Assurance Engineer with hands-on experience ensuring quality end-to-end in web applications, APIs, and integrations. I currently act as the sole QA in my team, being responsible for planning, executing, and evolving quality processes from requirements refinement to final delivery.

My background includes manual testing (functional, exploratory, regression), strong API testing with Postman, and test automation with Cypress (JavaScript) for critical business flows. I also have experience documenting test scenarios, reporting bugs with clear reproduction steps, and collaborating closely with developers and Product Owners in agile environments (Scrum/Kanban).

I’m pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and continuously expanding my technical skills, currently deepening my knowledge in mobile test automation with Appium and Java, backend quality, and scalable QA practices

Here on GitHub, I share studies, test automation projects, and experiments focused on software quality, reliability, and continuous improvement.
